      <h2>What's your return policy?</h2>
      <p>
        We don't offer returns and exchanges, but if there's something
        wrong with your order, please let us know by contacting us at <a href="mailto:sa@4yu4me4us.com">sa@4yu4me4us.com</a>!
      </p>

      <h2>Do you offer refunds?</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds are only offered to customers that receive the wrong items or
        damaged items. If any of these apply, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sa@4yu4me4us.com">sa@4yu4me4us.com</a> with photos of wrong/damaged items and we'll
        sort that out for you.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I exchange an item for a different size/color?</h2>
      <p>
        At this time, we don't offer exchanges. If you're unsure which
        size would fit better, check out our sizing charts—we have one for every
        item listed on our store, in the product description section. Though
        rare, it's possible that an item you ordered was mislabeled. If
        that's the case, please let us know at <a href="mailto:sa@4yu4me4us.com">sa@4yu4me4us.com</a> within a week after receiving your order. Include your order
        number and photos of the mislabeled item, and we'll send you a new
        one, or issue a refund!
